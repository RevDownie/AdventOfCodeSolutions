# Advent of Code Solutions
Solutions to some of the puzzles on http://adventofcode.com

Some little fun challenges where the idea is to do one a day in the run up to Xmas. Mostly concentrating on solving them quickly with small amounts of code
rather than focusing on the most optimal solutions. Mostly in Python - again for speed
